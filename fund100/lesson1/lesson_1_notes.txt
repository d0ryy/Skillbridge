Windows - FC (file compare)
Linux/Max - diff (difference)







git log : Shows every commit, by most recent. 
	git log --stat 
		shows which files (if multiple) where effected, and how many insertions and deletions
	git log --grep=word
		greps a word from the log list
		
git diff : similar to diff, but can compare different versions within git.
	git diff id1 id2
	




A good rule of thumb is to make one commit per logical change



Errors:
	
	Should not be doing an octopus
	Octopus is a strategy Git uses to combine many different versions of code together. This message can appear if you try to use this strategy in an inappropriate situation.
	You are in 'detached HEAD' state
	HEAD is what Git calls the commit you are currently on. You can “detach” the HEAD by switching to a previous commit, which we’ll see in the next video. Despite what it sounds like, it’s actually not a bad thing to detach the HEAD. Git just warns you so that you’ll realize you’re doing it.
	
git checkout : Changes from current repository to old one, allowing you to revert
	git checkout (ID)

git workspace:
	git config --global core.editor "'/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl' -n -w"
	git config --global push.default upstream
	git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
