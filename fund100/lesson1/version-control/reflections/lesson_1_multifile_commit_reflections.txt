Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


Git was probably made with coding in mind, oppose to google docs / dropbox where they are based on individual files (Photos, Documents, etc) where it wouldn't make sense to save multi files clumped together.
