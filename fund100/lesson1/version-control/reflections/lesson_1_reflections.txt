Having the program show you only the changed between two files help when it comes to parsing. For example, if you manually look at the code you would have to check over 1000+ lines of code to try and find the issue. If you are using the file change command or diff command, it only shows the few lines that are different. Allowing you to see only around 10 lines instead of the 1000+ lines. It allows you to compare alot quicker.
